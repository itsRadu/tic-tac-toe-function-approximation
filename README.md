# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Function Approximation

This project implements a tic-tac-toe game using a function approximation approach, inspired by Tom Mitchell's machine learning textbook. The AI agent learns to play the game by approximating the value of each board state and selecting the optimal moves.

## Implementation Details
- **Language:** Python
- **Approach:** Linear function approximation for state values
- **Outcome:** The AI achieves near-perfect play, making it a challenging opponent.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `TicTo.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells sequentially to train the AI and play against it.

## Results
The AI successfully learns to play tic-tac-toe and can play against human opponents or other AI agents.
